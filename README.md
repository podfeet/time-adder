Time Adder is designed to allow users to enter multiple elapsed time values in hours, minutes, and seconds and calculate the sum of the elapsed times.  New rows can be added to allow for more times to be added. If desired, negative values can be used to subtract time.

Total elapsed time is calculated simply by adding up the number of seconds in each row and adding/subtracting them from the total and then redisplaying in hours, minutes, and seconds.
